\n ** What is a variable ? **
\n Variable is a container for your stored data . When ever you assign a value to variable computer reserves some space for it in its memory  and inside that space the value is stored .
\n To use a variable we have to create it , and it requires some steps  , while you are learning python so it is quiet easy to do this job 

\n variable name = value 
\n x = 5
\n but while naming a variable you have to be carefull of some steps :
\n 01 - Must start with an alphabet or underscore 
\n 02 - Can contain only letters , alphabets and underscores 
\n 03 - Can not use reserved words 
\n 04 - Spaces in between are not allowed
\n 05 - Case sensitive 

\n ** How to print a Variable ? **
\n printing a varaiable is not same as printing a common line , you have to just not write your variable name in " " unless you want it to be write in " " 
\n var = 23
\n print ( var )
\n if you want to show your variable in " " , then simply use string methood ;
\n print ( f ' " { var} " ' )

\n ** Data types in Python **
\n 01 - Numbers → int, float, complex
\n 02 - Text → str
\n 03 - Sequences → list, tuple, range
\n 04 - Mapping → dict
\n 05 - Sets → set, frozenset
\n 06 - Boolean → bool
\n 07 - Binary → bytes, bytearray, memoryview
\n 08 - Special → NoneType

 \n ** How input and output functions work ** 
 \n when you want to print some line ;
\n print ( "that line ")
\n when you wnant to print var ;
\n print ( var_name )
\n when you wnat to print both ;
\n print (f' hello {var_name} is on call ' )

\n when you want to take simple input ;
\n var_name = input( " enter your name " )
\n when you want to specify datatype also while taking input ;
\n var_name = int ( input (" your age " ))
